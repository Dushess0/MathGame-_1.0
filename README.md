# MathGame-_1.0
Simple game about math writted in python + kivy. Win condition is having more points at the end of the game than your opponent. For more rules read readme :)

Your points counted like that : expression value + modificator ( at the beginning of the game =0)
Example:  your expression is x-y+z  and x=5,y=2,z=-2 and the modificator =0 so your score will be 5-2-2=1
Example: your expression is +10-(x+y-z)-5, x=0 y=6,z=-5 and  mod=0. 10-(0+6-5)-5= 10


By clicking at variables you can view their values. At the beginning of the game X=Y=Z=3.

Use card by clicking at it. After it you can insert number in highlighted position by clicking at it with right or left mouse button for
choosing in which side to insert. 
Example: your expression is +5-x+y+z you want to use card +10 to increase your score you want your 
expression look like this +5-x+10+y+z, so you must click with right mouse button at  X, or with left mouse button at Y.
